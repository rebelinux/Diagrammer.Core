# Support

Diagrammer.Core is actively maintained and supported by :simple-github: [rebelinux](https://github.com/rebelinux){:target="_blank"}. I value your feedback and am committed to resolving any issues you encounter with our PowerShell module. Questions, suggestions, and bug reports should be submitted to us using our public GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/rebelinux/Diagrammer.Core/issues){:target="_blank"}.

> **Note:** Our team addresses reported issues as time permits. We do not provide a guaranteed response time for reported issues at this time.

## What kind of support is available?

### :fontawesome-solid-bug: Bug fixes

Bugs are fixed for future releases of Diagrammer.Core and are not back-ported to previous versions.
The severity of the bug may influence how quickly a new version of the module is released.
If a bug is not reproducible on a supported version we may choose not to implement a fix. This helps prevent code from becoming unmaintainable, and ensures we do not distract our core developers with issues related to versions they no longer support.
Some bugs are caused by Graphviz itself rather than our PowerShell module. If we believe that to be the case, we will either assist you by providing you with the information you need to open a traditional support case, or we will open a bug report directly with the appropriate internal team at Graphviz. This will be done at our discretion.

### :fontawesome-solid-clipboard-question: General questions

Whether you are new to PowerShell, Graphviz, both, or neither, you are bound to have a question for us at some point. We want to hear it! Please create an "issue" at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rebelinux/Diagrammer.Core/issues){:target="_blank"} and we will respond.

### :material-feature-search-outline: Feature requests

If you have an idea for an improvement or new feature for Diagrammer.Core, let us know! Please create an "issue" at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rebelinux/Diagrammer.Core/issues){:target="_blank"} so we can start a dialog. Whether or not we choose to implement your feature, your feedback is incredibly important and highly motivating

### :octicons-discussion-closed-24: Discussions

We will occasionally post a topic for discussion in the discussions section on [Discussions](https://github.com/rebelinux/Diagrammer.Core/discussions){:target="_blank"}. These are great for broad discussions that don't necessarily fall under the category of "bugs" or "feature requests". If you're looking for a more casual chat, you can also reach me on the Diagrammer.Core [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q5bMhr24VN){:target="_blank"}.

## What Makes a Good Bug Report?

Reproducibility: Include steps that allow us to easily reproduce the issue.
Minimal Example: Strip down your example to the bare minimum necessary to exhibit the problem.
Clarity and Detail: Provide enough context for others to understand your environment and scenario.
By following these guidelines, you help us address issues faster and more effectively. Thank you for contributing to making Diagrammer.Core better!
