# Diagrammer.Core Limitations

Diagrammer.Core is a library for generating and manipulating diagrams programmatically. While it offers useful features, it has several limitations:

- **Limited Diagram Types**: Only supports basic diagram types (e.g., Hierarchical or simple relationships). Advanced diagrams (UML, ER, etc.) may not be fully supported.
- **Customization Constraints**: Styling and layout options are limited compared to dedicated diagramming tools. Fine-grained control over node/edge appearance may not be available.
- **Performance**: Rendering large or complex diagrams can be slow, especially with many nodes or edges.
- **Interactivity**: Lacks built-in support for interactive features (drag-and-drop, live editing) found in GUI-based diagram editors.
- **Export Options**: Output formats may be restricted (e.g., only SVG, PNG, JPG, PDF). Advanced export features (vector formats) might not be supported.
- **Integration**: May require additional work to integrate with other systems or workflows, especially for real-time or collaborative scenarios.
- **Documentation**: Documentation and community support may be limited compared to more mature libraries.

!!! note
    These limitations are based on typical features and constraints observed in Diagrammer.Core as of mid-2025. For the latest details, consult the official documentation.
